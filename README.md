# 3tier_app_k8s_AWS
In this project, I orchestrate a 3-tier php application on a Kubernetes cluster. The application consists of a frontend (php app), a backend (database management tool), and a database (mysql). I automated the launch of two AWS EC2 Instances as Master and Worker Nodes using Terraform and Ansible respectively.
